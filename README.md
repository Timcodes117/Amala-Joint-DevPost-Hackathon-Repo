The Amala Joint is a community-driven platform designed to make it easier to discover authentic Amala spots. 
Many people struggle to locate trusted joints, especially when moving to a new area or visiting unfamiliar places. 
Word of mouth and scattered online reviews often fall short, leaving hidden gems unnoticed.
