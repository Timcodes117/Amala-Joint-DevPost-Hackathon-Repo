# Signup Issue Debug Guide

## Problem Identified
The signup was showing "Signup failed" even after successful signup due to potential issues with:
1. Response parsing
2. Error handling logic
3. Backend verification URL inconsistency

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling & Debugging
- Added comprehensive console logging to track the signup flow
- Added handling for successful responses that might be caught as errors
- Improved error message extraction from axios errors

### 2. Fixed Backend Verification URL
- **File**: `flask_backend/app/routes/auth.py`
- **Issue**: Inconsistent verification URLs between signup and resend
- **Fix**: Changed signup verification URL from `/verify-email?token={token}` to `/auth/verify-user/{token}` to match the resend endpoint

### 3. Improved Signup Flow Logic
- Added explicit handling for `apiData.success === false` case
- Added fallback handling for successful responses caught in catch block
- Enhanced error logging for better debugging

## Debug Information Added

The signup page now logs:
- Request payload being sent
- Raw axios response
- Response status code
- Response headers
- Parsed response data
- Detailed error information if caught

## Testing Instructions

1. **Install react-toastify** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install react-toastify
   ```

2. **Test the signup flow**:
   - Open browser developer console
   - Go to signup page
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Check console logs for detailed information

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Console should show detailed logs of the request/response
   - Success toast should appear: "Account created successfully! Please verify your email."
   - Email verification modal should open
   - User should be logged in automatically

## Common Issues to Check

1. **Network Issues**: Check if the backend is running and accessible
2. **CORS Issues**: Verify CORS configuration allows the frontend origin
3. **Response Format**: Ensure backend returns the expected JSON structure
4. **Status Codes**: Check if 201 status code is being handled properly

## Next Steps

1. Test the signup flow with the debug logs
2. Check console output for any errors
3. Verify the backend is returning the correct response format
4. If issues persist, the debug logs will show exactly where the problem occurs

The enhanced error handling should now properly catch and display the actual error message instead of the generic "Signup failed" message.
